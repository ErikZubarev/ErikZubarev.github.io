    "AboutMeParagraph1":"<strong>Welcome to my portfolio!</strong> My name is Erik and I hold a bachelor’s degree in computer science, where my final essay focused on building a framework to identify key security features in AI systems for detecting phishing. I have been programming since middle school, where I joined a programming club in my free time. I found joy in learning and understanding computers at this early age, which continued into high school where I chose a technical program to learn programming at a higher level, and further into university where I earned my degree. This path has given me a deep understanding of the modern class-based programming paradigm, a broad range of programming languages, and a hunger to learn more.",
    "AboutMeParagraph2":"My core skills lie in <strong>Java, Linux, intuitive and accessible design, as well as problem-solving </strong>. I work best in collaborative environments, but I need time to be able to think things through on my own. I enjoy tackling challenges head-on, and am constantly seeking opportunities to learn something new. As a student assistant, I focused on understanding others’ perspectives, which made me a more effective mentor and teacher. Above all, I am sharp and learn quickly, which allows me to adapt to new tools, frameworks, and ideas easily.",
    "AboutMeParagraph3":"I care deeply about my privacy and security. I always make an effort to understand and customize the devices I use, for instance my phone and home computers run custom operating systems. Doing everything myself can be more difficult, but it’s important to me to learn how my devices work and to have the ability to solve problems independently. In the future, I intend to expand my independence by building my own server.",
    "AboutMeParagraph4":"Outside of technology, I’m a well-rounded individual with many interests. I play the piano, stay physically active, and regularly practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I also enjoy taking cycling trips and have participated in races. I also have niche interests such as architecture, cooking and science.",
    "ProjectsIntro":"<strong>This section showcases the best projects I have worked on.</strong> These are some of the best projects that illustrate my knowledge and abilities. Each project links to my GitHub if you need access to the code",
    "ProjectsProject1Header": "<a href=\"https://github.com/PVT-15-3/HoopUp\" target=\"_blank\">HoopUp - The basketball app</a>",
    "ProjectsProject1text1": "HoopUp is a project that I and seven other people collaborated on during our studies at Stockholm University. With four designers and four programmers, we managed to create an innovative app that integrates APIs, unit testing, and databases to book basketball games, filter who can join, and have a chat for planning.",
    "ProjectsProject1text2": "I assumed the role of Scrum Master during the project and also helped with programming and unit testing. We actively used GitHub and followed the Agile Scrum model throughout the project, resulting in something we are all incredibly proud of. The project was mostly written in Dart using Flutter, and can therefore be downloaded on both iOS and Android.",
